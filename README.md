# ibmwatson-nlc-groundtruth

## Overview

This toolkit is a web application that can be used to configure an IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier service instance. For more information, see the [Bluemix Catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/natural-language-classifier/).

## Prerequisite Services

To work, this application requires the following Bluemix services
- Cloudant
- Natural Language Classifier

***

## Before you begin
Ensure that you have an IBM Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up](https://apps.admin.ibmcloud.com/manage/trial/bluemix.html?cm_mmc=WatsonDeveloperCloud-_-LandingSiteGetStarted-_-x-_-CreateAnAccountOnBluemixCLI). For more information about development on Bluemix, see [Developing Watson applications with Bluemix](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/gs-bluemix.shtml).

## Give it a Try!

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://hub.jazz.net/git/wdctools/ibmwatson-nlc-groundtruth)

When you click this button, the application will

1. Prompt you to log in to Bluemix, or to create an account
2. Create a Bluemix DevOps Services project and initialize a new Git repository
3. Clone the ibmwatson-nlc-groundtruth project into the Git repository
4. Build your copy of the application
5. Create the required Bluemix services
6. Deploy the application to Bluemix

Your new DevOps Services project will be set up to automatically deploy changes to Bluemix when you commit new changes to your Git repository.

The entire process will take several minutes to complete. The final deploying step typically takes the longest. When it completes, you'll see a confirmation message and link to the running app. 

## Using the App

For information on using the app to customize the NL Classifier see [documentation link]. You can bring your own data or check out sample NL Classifier applications and data at our [App Gallery](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/gallery.html).
