# IBM Watson&trade; Natural Language Classifier Toolkit - ChangeLog

## Beta 0.0.2 - Friday, September 11th, 2015

* Improved overall system performance and stability by moving more features to the backend - including much of the data import and export functionality.
* Added an IBM Bluemix DevOps Services Build & Deploy pipeline to the repository which allows anyone to run a full build using the "Deploy to Bluemix" button. This change also makes it easier for other developers to modify and contribute to the project, but deployments will be a little slower.
* Reduced the number of API calls being made to the server to check on classifier training status.
* Added the ability the import multiple files at the same time from the UI.
* Refined the UI and corrected a variety of minor glitches in the user interface.

## Beta 0.0.1 - Friday, August 21st, 2015

* Initial beta release
